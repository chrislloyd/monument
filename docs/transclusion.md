# Transclusion

**Transclusion** is the process of including content from one document or source dynamically within another, rather than copying it. This ensures that updates to the original content are reflected in all places where it is transcluded.

The concept of **transclusion** was introduced by [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) in the 1960s as part of his [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu). He envisioned a system where documents could reference portions of other documents without duplication, maintaining a seamless and interconnected web of information. **Transclusion** influenced modern web technologies, including HTML's [`<iframe>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) and [`<object>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object) elements, wikis (e.g., MediaWiki templates), and [[Markdown transclusion]] found in [[Obsidian]].

Personal theories as to why transclusion isn't more popular:

1. Historical performance penalties associated with `<iframe>`
2. Lack of intrinsic sizing (unlike images where content size is embedded in headers)
3. Hyperlinks are a [[Narrow Waist]]
4. Tabs offer user controlled organisation rather than content controlled organisation
