**Monument** is a study in building a programming environment from the ground up
for AI. Our current operating systems are based around files, processes,
buttons. AI uses tokens, tools and Markdown.

What is a "programming environment"? It's not VSCode. It's closer to
[LISP machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine),
the [Canon Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Cat) or
[Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/2024/FAQ/#What_do_you_mean_by_dynamic_medium). 
[Cursor](https://cursor.com) and [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
are useful additions to today's dead (as in
[the opposite of live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfytHvgHybA)) programming
environments because they only involve editing code and not any actual execution. A programming environment (by my definition) is both live (in that it involves dynamic execution) and malleable (you can edit it while it runs).

If all of this sounds lofty and grand - please be kind and learn from my
mistakes. ✌️
