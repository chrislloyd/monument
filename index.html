  Monument is intended as study in building an OS around tokens. Our current
  operating systems are based around files and directories, but this doesn't map
  cleanly to the way generative models consume data. Our lives will increasingly
  be intertwined with AI and the context (or prompts) that we provide these
  models is the new file system.
